        Captain America is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
        Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1
        (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed
        as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most
        popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the
        Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics
        revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

      <p class="paragraph-section">
        The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield
        which he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man enhanced
        to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in
        World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was
        revived in the present day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of
        his time with its modern realities, he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes
        becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.

        Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of
        the 1944 movie serial, Captain America. Since then, the character has been featured in other films and
        television series. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character was portrayed by Chris Evans in
        Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), The Avengers (2012), a cameo of Loki masquerading as Captain
        America in Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),
        a cameo in Ant-Man (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), a cameo in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017),
        Avengers: Infinity War (2018), a cameo in Captain Marvel (2019), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).
