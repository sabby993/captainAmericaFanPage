        Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, Captain America and his alter ego Steve Rogers
        have become household name in the comics universe since he first appeared in Captain America #1 in
        March 1941. He was a frail young man living in the 40s who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection
        by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of
        the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day.

        His special abilities include peak human strength , speed, durability, agility, reflexes, sennses, accelerated healing
        factor and mental processing via the Super-Soldier Serum. He is also a master of mixed martial arts and he is also a master
        tactician, strategist and field commander. He also wields his iconic Vibranium-steel alloy shield which is nearly indestructible.

        Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently
        deferring to his orders in battle. The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and other heroes choose Rogers as their leader during the
        Secret Wars. Thor says that Rogers is one of the very few mortals he will take orders from, and follow "through the gates of Hades".
        he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his
        human physique. Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently
        capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique.
        Stan Lee claimed that he'd "always been fascinated by the fact that, although Captain America has the least spectacular super-power
        of all, the mantle of leadership falls naturally upon him, as though he was born to command... Cap is one of the hardest hero
        characters to write, because the writer cannot use some exotic super-power to make his episodes seem colorful... All he has to serve
        him are his extraordinary combat skills, his shield, and his unquenchable love for freedom and justice." Well said Stan.
